git clone url == clones a folder

git status == checks status; looks for changes
git add *repository* == offically adds it to the repository 
git commit -m "---" == Creates a new version in local rep 
git push == syncs to Github
git pull == pulls files from Github to working repository
	git merge == if the working rep copy has changes that the GitHub rep doesn't, you merge

Process:
1. Write enough code to create a new feature, fix a bug, or complete some other small, selfcontained
task.
2. Add all files that you modified or created to the staging area.
3. Commit the staged changes to your local repository.
4. Push your commit from the local repository to GitHub.
